# Lotus Hello

Herein we build up from a very basic `Lotus::Router` with a lambda to a `Lotus::Application` using a controller & view rendering to say "Hello World!".

Start at `1_basic.ru` and follow them down to see how it grows from a very basic lambda to a single file app complete with view rendering in `6_application_and_views.ru`.

## Running

If you want to run these, install the `rack` and `lotusrb` gems, then run whichever `.ru` file you want with `rackup [.ru file]` and hit <http://localhost:9292/> to see the output.
